Topics + Areas

Background TB covered
  context for other projects
  Dist-Array [enthought]: distributed
    -- specific indices are "owned" by specific "engines" (on different machines)
    -- uses "Distributed Array Protocol" standard ((RW array sharing amongst multiple processes))
  Spartan : lazy + distributed processing [ssh]
  ortho/numpy indexing
  'save' to file operation (example?)

Somewhere...
  growth from (use in) Iris
  working methods
  relationship to NumPy
  relationship to (Blaze, Spartan, Dist-Array)
  
Intro

    lazy
    array properties
      square, shape
      indexing styles

  CONTENT SUMMARY (map)
  
Key features
  ((1)) ?? indexing
  ?? arrays and adapters
  aggregation
  stack + tile  [[the opposite of indexing]]
  arithmetic
  parallel evaluation (engine, nodes, concurrency)
    expression graphs

Future
  parallel execution // simultaneous evaluation
  proper strategies for speed+space division
  ?? the relation to multi-processing  (ref HPC) ??
